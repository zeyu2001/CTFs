# LakeCTF Qualifiers

LakeCTF is a jeopardy-style security hacking contest organized by the [polygl0ts](https://polygl0ts.ch/) CTF team and the [EPFL School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC).](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/)

My team did well enough to qualify for the finals held in Lausanne!
