# Level 1 - Scratching the Surface

## Scenario 1

### Challenge 1

> _We've sent the following secret message on a secret channel._
>
> _Submit your flag in this format: TISC{decoded message in lower case}_

We have a .wav audio file.

Open in Sonic Visualizer, and see that the channel 2 spectrogram looks like morse code.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/cf58423721c24761824c606e6c31dac9 (1).png>)

Extract the second channel into a seperate `out.r.wav` file:

```
sox file1.wav out.r.wav remix 2
```

Decode the morse code:

The flag is `TISC{csitislocatedinsciencepark}`

### Challenge 2

> This is a generic picture. What is the modify time of this photograph?
>
> Submit your flag in the following format: TISC{YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS}

We can see this in the EXIF data.

The flag is `TISC{2003:08:25 14:55:27}`

The name is adam.

### Challenge 5

> Which time was the user's most recent logon? Convert it UTC before submitting.

Windows Security Logs log the Logon events (event ID 4624).

Note that the required time is in UTC, which is provided in the raw XML.

### Challenge 6

> A 7z archive was deleted, what is the value of the file CRC32 hash that is inside the 7z archive?
>
> Submit your flag in this format: TISC{CRC32 hash in upper case}.

The command `7z l -slt archive.zip` shows us extended info for the files in the archive, including the CRC32 hash.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/c58f0cac3c3a41bd8ce92102bd6dc60e.png)

We can see the CRC value in the output.

```
CRC = 040E23DA
```

### Challenge 7

> Question1: How many users have an RID of 1000 or above on the machine?
>
> Question2: What is the account name for RID of 501?
>
> Question3: What is the account name for RID of 503?
>
> Submit your flag in this format: TISC{Answer1-Answer2-Answer3}. Use the same case for the Answers as you found them.

This information can be obtained using `wmic useraccount get name,sid`. The RID is the last part of the SID shown.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/891fe4f9f1ee4fe8940454b5ba2729ad.png)

The flag is `TISC{1-Guest-DefaultAccount}`.

### Challenge 8

> Question1: How many times did the user visit https://www.csit.gov.sg/about-csit/who-we-are ?
>
> Question2: How many times did the user visit https://www.facebook.com ?
>
> Question3: How many times did the user visit https://www.live.com ?

> Submit your flag in this format: TISC{ANSWER1-ANSWER2-ANSWER3}.

Edge has a `History` SQLite database that contains the web history.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/b27e8abd63034c2cba5a5ef2d6fe307b.png)

The who-are-we page was visited twice. The other two websites were visited 0 times.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/7753f4f3bf5640ab9e55599b7ff47abe.png)

The flag is `TISC{2-0-0}`.

### Challenge 9

> A file with SHA1 0D97DBDBA2D35C37F434538E4DFAA06FCCC18A13 is in the VMâ€¦ somewhere. What is the name of the file that is of interest?

I wrote a simple PowerShell script to find this.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\" -Recurse -Force |

ForEach-Object {
    if ((Get-FileHash -algorithm sha1 $_.FullName).Hash -eq "0D97DBDBA2D35C37F434538E4DFAA06FCCC18A13")
    {
        Write-Output $_.FullName
        break
    }
}
```

This outputs `C:\Users\adam\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\otter-singapore.lnk`, which links to `otter-singapore.jpg`.
