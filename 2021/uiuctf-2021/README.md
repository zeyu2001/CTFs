# UIUCTF 2021

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2821%29.png)

This was my first time playing the annual UIUCTF, and I must say it was a really great experience. [Social Engineering Experts](https://ctftime.org/team/154571) ended in 18th place, out of 658 scoring teams.

I tried my hand at a variety of challenges across categories such as forensics and web exploitation.

It was a tough 48 hours, but the satisfaction from solving each challenge was definitely worth it! Glad that [Angmar](https://angmar2722.github.io/CTFwriteups/2021/uiuctf2021/) and I pushed through, solving two of the challenges way past midnight and a few hours before the CTF ended.

I also won a $100 bounty for the first blood on Pwnies Please, a machine learning challenge that required solvers to generate adversarial examples to fool an image classification model.
